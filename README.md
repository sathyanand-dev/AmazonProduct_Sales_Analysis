# Amazon Sales Analysis

This project performs analysis on Amazon sales data to gain insights into sales trends, forecasting, clustering, product segmentation, and geographic analysis. It utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-sales-analysis.git


2. Install the required packages:

shell
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels


### Usage

1. Ensure that you have the Amazon sales data file (e.g., "Amazon Sale Report.csv") available.

2. Open the Python script "amazon_sales_analysis.py" in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

3. Modify the file path of the dataset in the code:

python
data = pd.read_csv("D:\sem-4\predictive analysis\Excel files\Amazon Sale Report.csv", dtype=data_types, low_memory=False)


4. Run the script to perform the analysis.

## Analysis Steps

The project includes the following analysis steps:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Handling missing values
3. Correlation analysis
4. Time series analysis and forecasting
5. Standardizing the data
6. Silhouette analysis for cluster selection
7. Clustering with the optimal number of clusters
8. Product segmentation analysis
9. Geographic analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a CSV file named "Amazon Sale Report.csv" containing Amazon sales data. Unfortunately, the file is too large to be uploaded to GitHub.

If you would like to obtain the dataset, please contact me via email at (k.k.v.dinesh33@gmail.com).

Kindly mention the purpose of your request and provide your intended use for the dataset.

Once you have obtained the dataset, you can place it in the project directory and update the code accordingly by replacing the file path with the correct path to the dataset file.
